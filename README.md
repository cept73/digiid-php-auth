DigiID demo site
===========================

Demo site implementation of [DigiID project/draft](https://github.com/bitid/bitid) for authentication.
If you like this work, you may send some DGB to me: dgb1q7027kxdlrhfptg084d2a4vcu386nr4zu4tsrlk

Based on the [digibyte/digiid-php](https://github.com/digibyte/digiid-php), which based on the work of [scintill/php-bitcoin-signature-routines](https://github.com/scintill/php-bitcoin-signature-routines) and using [PHPECC classes](https://github.com/mdanter/phpecc)

**DigiByte Authentication Open Protocol**

Pure DigiByte sites and applications shouldnâ€™t have to rely on artificial identification methods such as usernames and passwords. DigiID is an open protocol allowing simple and secure authentication using public-key cryptography.

Classical password authentication is an insecure process that could be solved with public key cryptography. The problem however is that it theoretically offloads a lot of complexity and responsibility on the user. Managing private keys securely is complex. However this complexity is already being addressed in the Bitcoin ecosystem. So doing public key authentication is practically a free lunch to digibyters.

**The protocol is described on the following BIP draft and is open for discussion :**

Demo
=====

You may see demo: https://DigiByteForums.io
Free Registration/Login by QR with ability to be forgotten.


Installation
============
* Create a MySQL database, import struct.sql into it.
* Configure database information and server url in config.php
* phpecc at classes/phpecc may be updated from https://github.com/phpecc/phpecc/tree/366c0d1d00cdf95b0511d34797c116d9be48410e


Notes
=====
* GMP PHP extension is required (most shared hostings don't have it, another reason to implement digibyted support)
* By default, it will only allow 1 user by IP to **try** login at the same time (once a user is logged, another user could start the login process), this example could be modify to allow several (no need to modify DigiID)
